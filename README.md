# Data Science Template

This is a template for a data science project in a Python Jupyter notebook. This README is mostly a template, and should be customized accordingly during project creation. Here's a checklist after making a new repository from this template:

- [ ] Ensure that you've installed [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/)
- [ ] Run `poetry init` to generate the [pyproject.toml](pyproject.toml) file, then `poetry add` and `poetry install` dependencies
- [ ] Create a `data/` directory and add relevant data files there
- [ ] Properly credit whatever data set is being used in the [data set section](#data-set) section of this README
- [ ] Fill in the [license](LICENSE) and (optionally) update the [license section](#license) of this README
- [ ] Fill out or delete the [contributing section](#contributing) of this README

The [setup.sh](setup.sh) script (Linux only!) has been added to assist with Poetry installation and other miscellaneous setup tasks.

## Data Set

The data set can be found [here]().

## License

Please consult the [license file](LICENSE).

## Installation

Make sure you have a compatible version of Python, as specified in the [pyproject.toml file](pyproject.toml), and that you've installed [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/). From there, you should be able to run `poetry install` to install the necessary dependencies and run the project.
